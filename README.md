plugin.video.bgtelevizor
=====================

This is a modified version of the neterra plugin for XMBC created by mr.olix@gmail.com, allowing for playback of TV streams on BGTelevizor.net. 
The plugin uses methods from module script.module.beautifulsoup. This should be installed automatically when you install from zip file. 
If not install the MyVideo.de plugin from Tristan Fischer which is available in the official XBMC addon repositiory. 

This plugin has been tested on XBMC running on Windows 8, as well as on the openELEC distribution for Raspberry Pi.

Note: In order for the plugin to run properly on the Raspberry Pi, a VC-1 decode key must be purchased from the pi store. (~$2)
The key is required to unlock hardware decoding of Windows Media Video on the device, otherwise only the audio stream will play.
